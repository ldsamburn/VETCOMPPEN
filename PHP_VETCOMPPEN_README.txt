Vet Comp and Pen Assessment  Readme.


I selected the PHP language just at random.  No real reason other than it supports object oriented programmming attributes.  

I considered using abstraction in this simple assessment but decided just to use a base class and inherit attributes and methods from that base class.

I used a procedural mechanism to move parameters to the classes as I saw the requirements dictated.

I kept it somewhat simple for reasons you understand.
